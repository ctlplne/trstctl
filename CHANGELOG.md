# Changelog

All notable changes to trstctl are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it reaches
1.0. trstctl is **pre-1.0 and under active hardening**: minor versions may carry
breaking changes, and the tagged versions below are development milestones, not
supported release lines (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the support policy and
[docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md) for what the running binary serves today).

This file is the human-readable companion to the git tags; the
[README roadmap](README.md#roadmap) describes what is planned.

## [Unreleased]

### Security & hardening
- Remediation pass (R0–R9) hardening the served, multi-tenant profile: served
  end-to-end **revocation** (a revoked credential stops validating in the product's
  inventory/records), an idempotent first-API-token bootstrap, served X.509 issuance
  with CDP/AIA/SKI and certificate-profile enforcement, quorum-gated cross-signing,
  versioned event envelopes with version-aware projections, bounded/tenant-scoped
  lifecycle history, and TTL'd idempotency keys.
- Supply chain: GitHub Actions and base/runtime images pinned by digest, the
  embedded-PostgreSQL binary pinned against a committed provenance manifest, a
  CycloneDX SBOM and `govulncheck` gate in CI, CODEOWNERS over the root-of-trust
  paths with required code-owner review, and checksum-verified CI tool installs.
- Docs/observability honesty: a reality-tested `docs/limitations.md` that states
  served-vs-library status for every advertised capability, so the binary cannot
  silently over-claim.

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), linked from the README and SECURITY.md (DOCS-005).

### Changed — web console information architecture (IA train)
- **Option A — refined rail.** The sidebar is re-grouped into four question-shaped
  bands (Inventory / Issue & automate / Detect & respond / Govern & administer) and
  every previously hidden product surface (CA hierarchy, certificate profiles, SSH
  trust, code signing, operations, notifications, privacy, integrate, API explorer)
  is now visible in navigation. One name per surface: nav label, page `<h1>`, and
  document title agree everywhere (a permanent `naming_parity` guard enforces it).
  Platform gains a dedicated **Editions & license** tab, quarantining commercial
  licensing rows off the operational Access and System tabs.
- **Option B — module workspaces.** A top-of-rail **Module** switcher (Certificates &
  PKI, Secrets, SSH, Signing, Fleet) scopes the middle band to one product; the
  cross-domain global planes (identities, discovery, risk, posture, graph, incidents,
  approvals, governance, audit) stay visible under every module. Module homes carry a
  thin served KPI strip that deep-links into filtered lists. The shared audit stream
  gains per-module lenses via `?module=` with a clearable scope chip — one stream, one
  hash chain, N lenses, never per-module silos.
- **Dashboard integrity & renew.** Real-mode dashboards render served data only (the
  fabricated demo trend/activity/bands are gone) and the four action KPIs are wired to
  live counts; the expiring-certificate worklist and detail drawer now offer Renew,
  wired to the identity lifecycle transition.
- **No route/URL changes.** The entire IA change is navigation chrome; every route
  keeps its path, so deep links, journeys, and muscle memory survive. Permanent CI
  guards (`naming_parity`, `nav_completeness`, `module_map`, demo-data isolation, docs
  IA parity) keep the fixed defect classes from returning.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-13
- Hardening milestone toward an enterprise-GA bar for the self-hosted, multi-tenant
  profile: isolated signer custody (sealed CA key persisted across restarts), the
  assembled control-plane server (`cmd/trstctl` → `internal/server`) serving the
  event spine, projections, orchestrator, and REST API, and the architecture linter
  (`tools/trstctllint`) enforcing AN-1/AN-3/AN-5/AN-8 in CI.
